DESCRIPTION
       The upgrade-server subcommand upgrades Payara Server to the specified
       version and distribution along with all ssh nodes in the domain.xml.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --username
           The username for the Payara Nexus server

       --version
           Specifies the version number of the new version of Payara to use

       --distribution
           Specifies the distribution of Payara Server to download. This can
           be payara, payara-web, payara-ml, or payara-web-ml. By default this
           is payara.

       --stage
           When enabled, the Payara Server being upgraded to is not installed
           in-place, and is instead staged with ".new" suffixes. The user is
           then expected to apply the upgrade using the supplied
           applyStagedUpgrade script, found under payara5/glassfish/bin.
           On Windows, this option is enabled by default and cannot be
           disabled.
           On Linux, this option defaults to false.

       --domaindir
           Specifies the domain root directory, the parent directory of the
           domain upon which the command will operate.

           The default value is as-install/domains.

       --usedownloaded
           Specifies a pre-downloaded Payara Server distribution zip file
           that you'd like to upgrade your existing installation to use,
           instead of downloading one from the Payara Nexus.

           When this option is specified, the username, password,
           distribution, and version parameters are all ignored and are
           no longer mandatory.
